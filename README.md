An interpreter for the esoteric language [Dick](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Dick), coded in Python 3.10
Dicklang was created by [Cybertelx](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Cybertelx)

This program uses the new structural pattern matching that was introduced in Python 3.10, therefore you have to use python 3.10+.

You can run dicklang code by using the dick.py file, of which has only one argument required, the path to the dicklang file.

```
~$ python3 dick.py -h

Run dicklang code.

positional arguments:
  file        The filepath for the dicklang code you want to run

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Reference the wiki page for further information about dicklang, I take no ownership for the idea of the language, I could only ever wish to be blessed with the train of thought its original creator had.
